# Cursor Popups Change Log

## 0.0.5
* Added config setting to change the size of popups.

## 0.0.4
* Change log created.
* Less mouse smoothing while an icon is shown, so movement is more accurate (but potentially more jittery).
* All users can select their mouse smoothing amount in the settings menu.
* Fixed bug where the scene needed to reload before newly joined players would show icons.
* Default option for seeing your own icon is now enabled instead of disabled.
